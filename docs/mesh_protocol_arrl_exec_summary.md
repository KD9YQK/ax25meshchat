# Mesh Networking Protocol — Executive Summary for ARRL Review

## Overview

This project implements an experimental amateur radio mesh networking protocol designed to operate within FCC Part 97 regulations. The system prioritizes transparency, spectral efficiency, and operator accountability.

The protocol supports low-bandwidth digital messaging over shared RF spectrum using conservative duty cycles and publicly documented formats.

## Key Compliance Points

- No encryption is used during amateur radio operation
- Compression is used only to reduce airtime and does not obscure meaning
- All packets include callsign-derived node identification
- Protocol behavior is fully documented and auditable
- Operators retain full control over timing and configuration

## Intended Use

- Amateur experimentation
- Emergency and field communications research
- Educational and club-based mesh networking projects

This protocol is not intended for commercial use or unattended wide-area automation.

## Summary

The design aligns with FCC Part 97 intent and established amateur digital communication practices. It is suitable for experimental deployment and technical review within the amateur radio community.
