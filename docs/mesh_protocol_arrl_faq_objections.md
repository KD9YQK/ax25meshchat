# Frequently Raised Questions and Responses (ARRL Review)

## Is this encryption?

No. Compression is used only to reduce airtime. No secret keys are used, and all payloads are reversible using public algorithms.

## Can messages be intercepted?

Yes. Any third party with protocol documentation can decode all transmissions.

## Is store-and-forward allowed?

Yes. Store-and-forward messaging has long precedent in amateur radio (e.g., packet BBS systems).

## Does this hide station identification?

No. Callsign-derived node IDs are included in every transmitted frame.

## Is this unattended operation?

No. Operators configure and control all nodes and timing parameters.

## Does this comply with Part 97 intent?

Yes. The protocol emphasizes transparency, shared-spectrum respect, and experimental use consistent with amateur radio principles.
